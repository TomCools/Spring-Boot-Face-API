      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>In this exercise, we will create an Attendance Registration Application. Many classes/courses need an Attendance List, either for legal or administrative purposes.
      This is a boring task to do by hand, so instead, we are going to do it by using Face Recognition.</p>
      <p>In the menu to the left, you see 3 pages:
          </p><ul>
              <li><strong>Classes Overview</strong>: This is the actual Front-End of our application.</li>
              <li><strong>Introduction</strong>: The page you are looking at right now :-).</li>
              <li><strong>Task Guidance</strong>: A page containing all the tasks that need to be executed to get the application to work .</li>
          </ul>
      <h2>Notes on Front-End</h2>
      <p>The front-end has been provided for you. You do not need to change any of the Javascript/HTML to complete the exercise.</p>
      <p>Since this is actually a Back-End exercise, the quality of the front-end is not perfect. There is little error handling and it is not as responsive as it should be. It is only tested on Google Chrome.
        <br>If you run into any issues, try to reload the page.
      </p>
      <h2>Notes on Face API-keys</h2>
      <p>The back-end uses API-keys to connect to a Cloud Service. This API has a limit of 10 calls/second and you need 3 calls to do the face detection.
        Because of this reason, other students may have been assigned a different API-key. <strong>Please, stick to the API-key that is assigned to you.</strong>
        </p><p><strong>The API-keys will be deleted after a given period, since they are the paid version of the keys.</strong>
        <br>If you want to continue with this project, you can <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/face-api">get your own free key here</a>, but it is limited to 20 calls/minute.
